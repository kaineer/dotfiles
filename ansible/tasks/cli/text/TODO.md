# Tasks to install and configure text-related tools

 * ripgrep - search for text inside files in filesystem
 * fd - search for file by name and extension
 * exa - pretty ls
 * bat - cat with wings, oh, output file content with highlighting

## Where to look for parts

 * ../text.yml
 * ../profile.yml

## More pretty

 * Move profile files into {tool}/profile files
 * Add version and arch variable into each text/{tool}.yml file
